# Guild Wars 2 AHK → MIDI / Tab Converter

**Version:** v0.17  
**Author:** Haze (`bitchazel` on Discord)

A desktop utility (Tkinter) to convert Guild Wars 2 AutoHotkey (`.ahk`) macro files — typically exported from MIDI-to-AHK tools — into a compact, readable tab-like notation for sight reading and quick reference. The app also supports batch conversion, chunked processing of long macros, and simple export/copy workflows.

> **Note:** The splash screen title displays *Guild Wars 2 AHK to MIDI Converter* for branding. The app's main functionality is converting AHK macros into readable tab notation.
